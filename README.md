An implementation of RESTbucks, a sample application for REST that first appeared in an [InfoQ article](http://www.infoq.com/articles/webber-rest-workflow) and subsequent a [book on REST](http://restinpractice.com/book/).

This implementation uses [Restful Objects for .NET](http://restfulobjects.codeplex.com) and [Naked Objects MVC](http://nakedobjects.codeplex.com).

First demo'd at [DDD Exchange, Jun 2012](http://skillsmatter.com/event/design-architecture/ddd-exchange-2012).
